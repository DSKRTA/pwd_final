# Sprite Images

Place your astronaut sprite images in this directory.

## Required Files

- `astronaut2.png` - Sprite for astronaut 2 (right side, will be flipped horizontally)

## Image Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Recommended size: 60x80 pixels or larger (will be scaled)
- Style: Pixel art style to match the game aesthetic
- Background: Transparent

## Fallback

If the sprite images are not found, the game will automatically use a fallback drawing method to render the astronauts.

## Usage

The game will automatically load sprites from this directory when it starts. Make sure the images are named exactly as specified above.
